# Macroeconomic-Projects
Files related to my Macroeconomic Theory projects during my undergraduate.  I was asked to recreate the graphs and charts with high percision in excel with the appropriate data from sources such as the St. Louis Federal Reserve and Bureau of Labor Statistics.  Additionally, I was sometimes asked to answer analysis questions.
